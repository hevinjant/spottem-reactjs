Spottem is a music-based social media. The goal of the project was to create a socially interactive Spotify experience where users can add friends who are Spotify users and see what music they are listening to in real time. It also gives the feature of interacting with friend's music and 'reacting (ex. giving like)' to individual songs.

Spottem was a class project and the idea behind it came from Aiden Nguyen, Limas Nursalim, Travis Hawley, and me. I was working on the back-end part with Limas, while Aiden and Travis were working on the front-end part. The front-end part was originally developed in React Native.

After the class was over, I decided to develop my own version of front-end in React JavaScript as my personal project.

Since the app is still in Spotify Development Mode, new users cannot log in to Spottem without having their email address registered manually in the Spotify developer dashboard's allowlist.
